Creating a calculator app using HTML and CSS is a great way to practice basic web development skills. This project will help you understand how to structure a webpage using HTML, style it using CSS, and integrate simple JavaScript to make it functional. Hereâ€™s an introduction to each part of the project:
1. HTML: Structuring the Calculator

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure of the webpage. For a calculator, you'll need to define the layout of the buttons and the display screen.1. HTML: Structuring the Calculator
